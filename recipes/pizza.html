    <h2>Detroit-Style Pizza</h2>
    <p>Forget the old Chicago vs. NY debate! America's best pizza could very well be Detroit-style pizza. Even though it's often referred to as 'deep dish,' I don't think that accurately captures the essence of this crispy, crusty, crazy-good slice. It has flavor elements of a slightly charred thin-crust pizza, with the texture of light, airy focaccia. Plus, if you use the properly shaped pan, the edges of your crust get wonderfully crunchy, making for a truly unique experience.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Â½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour warm water into the bowl of stand mixer</li>
        <li>Drizzle remaining olive oil over the bottom of a 10x14-inch Detroit-style pizza pan</li>
        <li>Combine marinara sauce, oregano, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder in a saucepan over medium-low heat. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 to 550 degrees F (260 to 288 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Dice Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese into small cubes. Toss lightly to mix together.</li>
        <li>Rub fingertips with some olive oil from the pan. Press out air from the dough</li>
        <li>Lay most of the pepperoni onto the dough.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is somewhere between golden brown and golden black, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes</li>
    </ol>
