    <h2>Vegan Burger Patties</h2>
    <p>Delicious dinner inspiration and easy to make. This vegan, gluten-free dinner option is a favorite of mine and an easy midweek go-to dinner. Quinoa, sweet potato, and kidney bean burgers that you can serve in a bun or on a bed of spinach topped with avocado, tomato, sauteed or pickled red onion, cilantro/coriander, and other favorite toppings. Yum!</p>
